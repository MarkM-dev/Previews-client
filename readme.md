<br/>


* **Auto channel points clicker**
    - This feature automatically clicks the green channel points redeem button.
    - It also works when chat is closed and when the tab or window is in the background.
      <br/><br/>


* **Sidebar streamer search**
    - A purple search button on the top of the sidebar to find live streamers easily.
    - Searches within the currently shown streamers so the sidebar will automatically extend to show all live streamers when you start searching.
      <br/><br/>


* **Sidebar extend**
    - Auto extends the sidebar to show all live streamers (when sidebar is open).
      <br/><br/>


* **Full screen with chat**
    - The button will show next to the 'theater mode' button in the player controls.
    - Clicking it will toggle browser fullscreen (like F11), theater mode and chat.
    - You can exit the mode by clicking the button again or double-tapping ESC.
    - When exiting the mode, your chat will go back to what it was before you entered 'fullscreen with chat' (unless you closed chat while in mode - then it will remain closed).
      <br/><br/>


* **Auto refresh when the main twitch player gets an error (#1000, #2000, #4000)**
    - This feature works when the tab with the player that got an error is currently active.
    - If the player got an error while the tab was not active (in the background or the browser wasn't the active window) the page will automatically refresh when you come back to it.
      <br/><br/>


* **Prevent Automatic Video Quality Change**
    - Prevents automatic video quality change when twitch is in the background (when switching tabs / tasks).
    - Notes on behavior with other features:
    - Auto refresh - if you have this enabled with auto-refresh enabled, the auto-refresh feature will refresh immediately upon error instead of waiting for you to return to the twitch tab if it wasn't focused (this is a better behavior).
    - Predictions notifications - if you have this enabled with predictions notifications enabled, predictions notifications will show even when chat is open in a focused twitch tab.
      <br/><br/>
      

* **Predictions notifications**
    - Predictions started and Predictions results notifications when you don't know it's happening (for example if your chat is closed or you are not in the tab or browser).
    - Works on twitch tabs in the browser.
    - When enabling the feature, you will need to allow notification permissions for twitch.tv (a prompt will show - if not, click on the lock icon on the left of the url and check if it's allowed there).
      <br/><br/>


* **Predictions sniper**
    - The predictions sniper will participate in predictions for you.
    - Works on twitch tabs in the browser.
    - The sniper will choose the prediction option with the most amount of votes received at the time of entry (x seconds before prediction closes).
    - If you have your chat open (no need), you will see the prediction menu for a split second when the sniper is entering a prediction.
    - You can enable the 'Predictions notifications' feature if you want to know what's happening in real-time.
    - If there is already a bet made on the prediction, the sniper will not add more points.
    - Settings:
        - Bet % - the percentage of channel points you want the sniper to bet.
        - Min vote margin % - a percentage representation of the minimum required vote margin between the two prediction options for the sniper to participate.
            - For example: option A- 100 votes, option B- 115 votes, vote spread: A-46.51% B-53.49%, vote margin: 6.98% (53.49% - 46.51%). if the minimum vote margin is lower than 6.98%, the sniper will participate in the prediction.
        - Seconds - the amount of seconds the sniper will make a prediction before the prediction closes (min 2s).
          <br/><br/>
    - Remember that this is a statistical tool and wins are not guaranteed.
    - <b>Note:</b> This is the first and basic version of the Predictions sniper feature and there are a lot more settings and functionality that this feature needs (like a history screen and individual settings per stream and more) and they will be added in the next versions. but for now, lets see how the basic version goes :)
      <br/><br/>


* **Picture in picture**
    - If you're in video preview mode, a small button will appear under the view count when you hover a streamer - click it and a persistent preview window will appear (using browser's PIP feature).
    - You can still use the regular previews alongside with PIP.
