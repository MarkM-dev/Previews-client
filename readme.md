    - Default Settings:
        - Bet % - the percentage of channel points you want the sniper to bet.
        - Max num of points - the maximum amount of points the sniper is allowed to vote with.
        - Min vote margin % - a percentage representation of the minimum required vote margin between the two prediction options for the sniper to participate.
            - For example: option A- 100 votes, option B- 115 votes, vote spread: A-46.51% B-53.49%, vote margin: 6.98% (53.49% - 46.51%). if the minimum vote margin is lower than 6.98%, the sniper will participate in the prediction.
        - Seconds - the amount of seconds the sniper will make a prediction before the prediction closes (min 2s).
          <br/><br/>
