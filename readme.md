* **picture in picture**
    - If you're in video preview mode, a small button will appear under the view count when you hover a streamer - click it and a persistent preview window will appear (using chrome's PIP feature).
    - You can still use the regular previews alongside with PIP.
<br/>


* **Sidebar streamer search**
    - A purple search button on the top of the sidebar to find live streamers easily.
    - Searches within the currently shown streamers so the sidebar will automatically extend to show all live streamers when you start searching.

* **Predictions notifications**
    - Predictions started and Predictions results notifications when you don't know it's happening (for example if your chat is closed or you are not in the tab or browser).

    - This feature is currently only for users who have twitch in English.
    - When enabling the feature, you will need to allow notification permissions for twitch.tv (a prompt will show - if not, click on the lock icon on the left of the url and check if it's allowed there).
<br/>


* **Auto page refresh when the main twitch player gets an error (#1000, #2000, #4000)**
    - This feature works when the tab with the player that got an error is currently active.
    - If the player got an error while the tab was not active (in the background or chrome wasn't the active window) the page will automatically refresh when you come back to it.
    - This feature is turned off by default and can be turned on in the extension options.
<br/>


* **Auto bonus channel points clicker**
    - This feature automatically clicks the green channel points redeem button.
    - It also works when chat is closed and when the tab or window is in the background.
    - This feature is turned off by default and can be changed in the extension options.
