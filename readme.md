## **Twitch Previews - a live video or image preview window on Twitch.**
                                                                                     
**Twitch Previews creates a live video or image preview window when a user hovers the mouse over a streamer card on the left navigation sidebar.**


## How to use:

1. **Add the extension to chrome.**
    - If you already have a twitch tab opened - refresh it.

2. **Hover your mouse over a streamer card on the left navigation bar.**
    - A preview window will appear next to the hovered card.
<br/>

- if you're in Video mode (on Chrome), a small button will appear under the view count, click it and a persistent preview window will appear (using chrome's PIP feature).
- To change between an image preview or a live video preview click the extension at the top bar and use the toggle button.
- To resize the preview window click the extension icon at the top bar and use the Preview size slider.
