<br/>
<br/>

## Download
**Extension is available for Chrome and Firefox:<br/>**

**[Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitch-previews/hpmbiinljekjjcjgijnlbmgcmoonclah/
) | [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitchpreviews/)**
<br/>
<br/>

## Features:
- Image or Live video stream preview.
- Previews in sidebar & directories.
- Preview resize.
- Chrome only - Auto page refresh when the main twitch player gets an error (#1000, #2000, #4000).
- Chrome only - Picture In Picture via the button under the viewcount in the list (when in video mode).
- Also supports inverted twitch layout (when chat is on the left and streamers on the right).
<br/>

## How to use:
1. **Add the extension to chrome/firefox.**
    - If you already have a twitch tab opened - refresh it.

2. **Hover your mouse over a streamer on the navigation sidebar or in a twitch directory.**
    - A preview window will appear next to the hovered card.
<br/>
<br/>

- if you're in Video mode (on Chrome), a small button will appear under the view count, click it and a persistent preview window will appear (using chrome's PIP feature).
<br/>

* **Auto page refresh when the main twitch player gets an error (#1000, #2000, #4000)**
    - This feature works when the tab with the player that got an error is currently active.
    - If the player got an error while the tab was not active (in the background or chrome wasn't the active window) the page will automatically refresh when you come back to it.
    - This feature is turned off by default and can be turned on in the extension options.
